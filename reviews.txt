Hi I am satisfied with what I've experienced in groww... although I heard some cases where other customers went through something... but in my case... the things I've experienced and realized is every has some buy and sell issues... I quite like the interface here... plus making orders is quite easy... and charges are too low/high for the investors who've just begun. In the end, I've some suggestions for groww like improving customer support, also the app speed... and the graphs too that's it.

My overall experience is good with the app. The only issue I am facing recently is the capital gain statement report for stocks. Even though I am trying to generate report for the previous financial year, it is including transactions from the current financial year as well. I am not able to calculate capital gains from my statement and need to manually calculate it because of the issue. Request Groww team to resolve this issue asap

SEBI AND RBI RULES ARE IGNORED. I don't like auto pay. No option was given while investing in groww funds. Also autopay will be set up if groww pay is used. . One click for one sip is enough to set all other sips to get autopay mandate. But cancellation has to be done individually. Such an audacity. Not ok. I just cancelled every sip individually. Will Uninstall this app by 31st of this month.
Quite easy to understand and invest

Please update OI CHANGE DATA too. Over all Good.

The app is user-friendly and stable. Just a suggestion: it would be great if all investments could be viewed on one page with a pie chart showing the breakdown, like 60% Mutual Funds and 40% Equity. This feature would enhance the overall experience. Keep up the good work!

I have issue with your pledge share policy. You only give pledge share some selected nifty 50 shares. I mainly do intraday trading . I took delivery some stocks and thought that i will pledge them. But when i try to pledge them, most of the shares are unavailable to pledge, but the stock like Rvnl (railway Vikas Nigam limited) is unavailable to pledge where you can get maximum haircut in rvnl share on zerodha and other leading platform. Your most share unavailable to pledge and your haircut is

Before investment, it shows the graph in green, saying towards rising for about 200rs, and after investment, the graph goes in red falling, say about 500 rs per share...! Why...?
